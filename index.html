<h1>U.S. Officer On Duty Deaths</h1>
<p>
Between 2005 and 2014, 1,100 U.S. officers were killed on duty, whether accidentally or feloniously. These deaths occurred as a result of anything from arrest situations, traffic pursuits/stops, or ambush situations, to handling people with mental illnesses, or responding to disturbance calls. Taking a closer look at the data, we can see that the region with the most officers killed feloniously is the South. This may be due to high racial tensions in the South. Especially recently, the news has been consistent with stories of police brutality towards African Americans, with cases like Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown, and Sandra Bland. Two of these cases, Trayvon Martin and Sandra Bland, happened in the South (Florida and Texas, respectively).
